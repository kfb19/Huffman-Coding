The Great TsunamiBY MICHELE WOLFShe recognizes its crest in the way he looks at her. The wave is as vast as the roiling mass in the JapanesePrint they had paused in front of at the museum,Capped with ringlets of foam, all surging sinew.That little village along the shore would beTotally lost. There is no escaping this.The wave is flooding his heart,And he is sending the floodHer way. It rushesOver her.Can you look at one faceFor the whole of a life?Does the moon peer downAt the tides and hunger for home?
